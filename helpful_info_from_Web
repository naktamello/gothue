A few years ago I tried the same thing as an excercise. I started with basically 
the same method you suggested, because the matlab documentation guided me that
way. 
It is good to mention, that for any practical use there a two critical points for
the performace. The first and most critical is to find the middle of the dial, which can be
solved by solid camera calibration but if the gauge changes physically in 
the picture most papers I found said that they let the user point out the
middle of the dial. 
The second one is the look of the dial itself. If you face a precission measurement
instrument, chances are it has a very clean dial and a needle pointer.
In that case you can easily tranform the picture to binary and search for 
activeted pixels in a small range. 

I endded up selecting the middle of the dial myself once. Then I just 
grayscaled the images (extracted from a video stream) and applied a 
polar transform. To find the pointer I used the longest line the Hough Transform
found in a preselected width spanning over the markings an some of the pointer.
You can get the reading very
easily that way because you know the range (min and full scale deflection) of 
the dial and you can scale the image when transforming using the polor coordinates.
Hence, if the resulting image is 720px high, and the longest line starts in
row 360 the pointer deflection is 180 degree.
